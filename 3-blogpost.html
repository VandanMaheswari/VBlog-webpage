      <p class="font1">Human Attachment <br><br>
        Attachments do not only happen with human beings, it do happen with animals and non-living things too and i think that's far better 
        than human attachments. But today we are going to talk about only human attachments. <br>
        Google definition of it is - Attachment can be defined as a deep and enduring bond between two people in which each seeks closeness and feels more
        secure when they are in the presence of an attachment figure. <br>
        In my language, the definition of attachment is: It is the feeling of having someone who always stand by you.You can share your feelings openly with them. 
        You can openly talk to them. When you get attached to another person, you blindly trust him/her. It may be your best friend, lover, cousin, 
        sibling, or anyone else. <br><br>
        For instance, when you go somewhere for study or for work, you meet new people. At first, they are your colleagues or your classmates. 
        Then you start talking with them. If you feel like he/she matches your vibes and you like his/her nature and behaviour, you want to become friends with 
        him/her. Maybe he/she also likes you and wants the same. Then you starts to spend more time together at work or maybe even started to hang out. 
        Then slowly, you start feeling closer to that person. You now even share your secrets with the other person, and maybe he/she does the same. 
        You begin to believe that no one else can take my place in his/her life. Now you have started to show your possessiveness towards that person.You feel bad when that person do not give you attention and start talking to other people in the same way he/she talk to you. You starts taking care of him/her. 
        Your feelings now depend on his/her presence and attention. You obsess over his/her every single move. You feel that you cannot live without him/her now. You cannot even think of detaching from that person.
        <br><br>
        Human attachment is injurious to health.  <br>
        Why did I say that? Because once you get attached to someone, it's very difficult to get detached from them.
        You then never want to be detached in life and once you get detached, it's even more difficult to move on from that person. 
        When you become attached to someone, no matter how many times he or she hurts you, you ignore it because you believe
        that detachment from that person will be very difficult for you. And yes, it is very difficult because you shared everything with that
        person and then leaving them, or fear of them leaving you, even this thought is very frightening and painful.
        Also attachment carries expectations with them. It's a natural process. Expectation comes naturally when there is a person with whom you are attached so much. 
        When that expectation is broked by the other person, then it breaks you as well. After ignoring the hurt given by that person again and again (maybe unknowingly)
        by breaking your expectations, you finally decide to be apart from them. <br><br>
        There are so many stages in life when you get attached to someone and in the next phase to some other one. 
        But keep in mind that attachment from someone is fine, but excessive attachment from someone is hazardous to your health. 
        Once my father teach me that, "You should not attach someone to this level that they get the power to hurt you."
        Do not become so attached to someone that detachment from them has the power to destroy you. Remember that detachment is 80% possible in many cases. 
        Therefore, whenever you think that you are getting closer to someone, take care of everything and be ready for any consequences.
        One more thing: attachment and love are different, so do not confuse between them. <br><br> 
        If you really want to be attached and love someone, the best people are your mom, dad, and God, who will never hurt your feelings.
