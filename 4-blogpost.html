        IMPORTANT: The end of this article gives you an important life lesson.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        Hey there, looking for some sweet ass motivation? Well, you’re in luck,
        because I got the most awesome, most unoriginal motivational content
        you’ve seen a hundred times before. <br /><br />

        And what do you know? It happens to be exactly what you’re in the market
        for. So here is the ultimate 3-step program for shaping yourself into a
        winner you always knew you could be (despite never actually doing
        anything to become one). <br /><br />

        Okay, a few paragraphs are enough for an obligatory intro, right? Of
        course it is, nobody reads this shit anyway. Let’s just dive straight
        into it so you can get yourself hyped up for about 20 minutes, then go
        back to procrastinating and reading generic self-help advice which tells
        you exactly what you want to hear. Ready? All right, let’s go.
        <br /><br />

        STEP 1: YOU’RE AWESOME Do you sometimes feel bad? Are people mean to
        you? Are you scared of taking chances and doing what truly makes you
        happy, so you often conform to other people’s opinions just to fit in?
        Aw shucks, that sounds sad. <br /><br />

        Don’t be sad. Be happy instead. Happiness is what everyone should
        achieve in life, while avoiding stressful situations, uncomfortable
        emotions, and challenging obstacles. Despite what people who actually
        study the human mind and behavior say, these are not things that
        strengthen your mindset, develop quality habits, shape your personality,
        and make you a stronger individual. Some call these people scientists,
        some call them experts, but their real title is haters. <br />
        <br />

        Important note: Criticism is something very, very bad. It’s not
        something you can learn from to improve yourself. It’s not significant
        if 90% of people hate what you’re doing. It’s not important if you could
        do things differently and achieve a better effect. Why? <br /><br />

        Because you’re awesome. Everybody is awesome. If you’re alive, you’re
        awesome. You don’t become an awesome person by doing good deeds,
        advancing your skills and knowledge, putting in hard work, and
        developing yourself into a smart, capable, and interesting individual.
        Heck no! <br /><br />

        If people hate talking to you and avoid social contact, don’t think
        something might be wrong with you. Maybe you talk too much? Maybe you’re
        too judgmental? Maybe you don’t have anything important to say? Forget
        these things. Remember, you’re awesome just for being you. You don’t
        have any bad traits. There are no flaws in your behavior. There is no
        room for improvement. <br /><br /><br />

        You’re perfect just the way you are. <br /><br /><br />

        STEP 2: YOU’RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL You have an idea for a project?
        Thinking of writing a book? Starting a business? YouTube channel? Blog?
        Go for it. I’m sure it’s a unique, never-been-done-before idea. And if
        you think it might suck, don’t. Your every idea is amazing because, as
        we’ve learned, you’re awesome and criticism is bad. If you could
        actually learn something from criticism, it would mean that it is not
        necessarily bad. And that’s just crazy. <br /><br />

        Statistics say that 9/10 startups fail and that almost half of them fail
        because there was no market need for their product or service. In other
        words, nobody was interested in their shit in the first place. But those
        brave souls refused to listen to haters and kept going. The final
        outcome is not relevant. <br /><br /><br />

        Let’s pull up some statistics of our own. Spoiler alert – they are going
        to blow your mind: <br /><br /><br />

        Walt Disney was fired because his boss felt he “lacked imagination and
        had no good ideas”<br />
        Oprah Winfrey was publicly fired from her first television job for
        getting “too emotionally invested in her stories”<br />
        Steven Spielberg was rejected by the School of Cinematic Arts multiple
        times Thomas Edison’s teachers told him he was “too stupid to learn
        anything”<br />
        Jay-Z couldn’t get any record label to sign him <br />
        All these people later went on to become extremely successful and
        well-known in their respective fields. They didn’t listen to what others
        told them and they didn’t let the haters discourage them. They kept
        pushing until they achieved their dreams. <br /><br />

        This, of course, doesn’t mean that they failed many, many, many times
        before succeeding. It doesn’t mean that they had hundreds of shit ideas
        before finding one that was actually good. It also doesn’t mean they are
        exceptionable people who spent endless hours, months, and years
        perfecting their craft, thinking of new ideas, learning and evolving
        from criticism (although we prefer the term hatorade) and making
        sacrifices for a better future. <br /><br />

        The only thing that we can learn from these fun facts is that they were
        just normal, ordinary people – like you. If they could do it, why
        couldn’t you? If you want it hard enough, you’ll definitely be
        successful one day (regardless of how much work you actually put in).
        <br /><br />

        Why? Because you’re awesome. <br /><br />

        STEP 3: EASY SOLUTION Now that we’ve gotten your blood pumping, thinking
        about the badass you’re going to become, making it rain in the clubs,
        living in a mansion, doing what you love, hanging out with celebrities,
        having a stable (?) personality and a winner’s mentality, let’s talk
        about how to actually get there. <br /><br />

        The first step is kind of obvious – read articles like this every day.
        Otherwise, you won’t have the mental strength to achieve what you want.
        I mean, all those successful people’s vision and dedication are surely
        not enough to motivate them. Simply wanting it is not enough, you need
        people like us to tell you that you want it. <br /><br />

        So here is a general outline of our life plan: <br />

        Read motivational articles. <br />
        ?????????<br />
        PROFIT! <br />
        Now, people who are actually successful put in thousands of hours
        working and learning and failing and improving and failing and
        perfecting and failing and hustling. That’s all good for them, but let’s
        be honest – do you want us to tell you how to actually achieve
        something? That it takes years, hard work, sacrifice, and adapting new
        and foreign ideas? <br /><br />

        Fuck no. We all know you’re not looking for actual change. That shit’s
        hard. You want the easy solutions, the quick methods, the “5 Steps to
        Gaining Respect” and “3 Ways to Become a Winner”, the “How to Get the
        Best Boyfriend” and “6 Best Places for Meeting DTF Chicks”. <br /><br />

        As Dom Mazzetti so eloquently put it: <br /><br />

        I don’t want someone to enrich my life, I want someone to reassure me
        that my shitty life is adequate. <br /><br />

        And when it comes to haters who try to give you all the complicated,
        scientific-based information on how our minds work and how to make real
        change: <br /><br />

        It’s the same reason I don’t read books, because books intimidate me and
        remind me how dumb I am. Why should I waste time getting smarter or
        making peace with my insecurities, when I can just level the playing
        field and watch Digimon reruns with my [mentally challenged] cousin?
        That sounds like a Saturday to me! <br /><br />

        So don’t fret about the haters and experts. We’re here to hold you
        tight, tell you you’re awesome no matter what, and that whatever path
        you choose in life is great. As we’ve established in Step 1, you can do
        nothing wrong. <br /><br />

        Life isn’t about learning from mistakes, it’s about disregarding the
        notion of a “mistake”. Because you’re awesome. <br /><br />

        STEP 4: DO NOTHING <br />
        “What’s this? Step 4?” – an avid reader exclaims. – “But I thought you
        said it was a 3-step solution?” <br /><br />

        Well, my avid motivation approval-seeking friend, if you’re able to read
        through all the shit advice we provide on a daily basis without
        vomiting, then you’ve proven you’ll gobble up basically anything we
        throw at you. So let’s call this the “Bonus Chapter”, which we included
        because we’re just nice like that. <br /><br />

        Some writers actually take time to research and back up what they
        say…but who the hell has time for that? I can fart out another “Top 10
        Reasons You’re Awesome” fluff piece in half an hour and you would still
        eat that shit up. You don’t care about the quality of the content you
        read, so why should we? <br /><br />

        Have you seen our “motivational content” sites? We’ve got like 13
        different sidebars with subscription boxes, social media links,
        advertisements, share buttons, and all the shit we’re trying to sell
        you. Since actual “content” makes up about 15% of any page, I’m
        surprised you’re even able to find it. It’s like playing “Where’s
        Waldo?” every time you open up a new post. <br /><br />

        If you really did have a winner’s mentality, you’d be reading something
        with actual substance in it (like this or this or this). You would be
        working, learning, and improving yourself, not leaving bland comments
        like “OMG that is so true, I do need to respect myself (because, like, I
        didn’t know that before reading this)”. <br /><br />

        But you still read our unoriginal posts, because we tell you what you
        want to hear. We tell you that everything about you is great, and if
        something happens to be a little off-balance, you can fix it in five
        easy steps. Because if you were actually interested in changing yourself
        in a meaningful way, you would be smart enough to see through our
        bullshit. <br /><br />

        Because if you were actually awesome, you wouldn’t need us to tell you
        that. <br /><br />

        Every Generic Self-Help Writer Ever <br /><br />

        *** <br /><br />

        P.S. Apparently, a lot of you don’t realize this article is making fun
        of generic self-help bullshit. Even worse, some of you share this
        thinking it’s a genuine motivational article — probably because you
        didn’t even read the fucking thing. <br /><br />

        If that’s you, I want to tell you something. Reading empty motivational
        articles telling you exactly what you want to hear will never get you
        anywhere. Instead, I’ve put together a little ebook that will teach you
        how to actually start improving your life. <br /><br />
