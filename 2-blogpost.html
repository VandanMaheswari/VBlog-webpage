      <p class="font1">"Trust Yourself"
        Life is full of unannounced events. We can't even imagine what will happen next to us in life. We have many phases in life. Sometimes we feel happiness 
        and in the very next minute we feel sadness for some reason. We can't control anything in the universe. We can not even control our feelings, but What we can control is just our mind. 
        Many times in life, it happens that we cannot understand the things that are going on. At that time, we get so
        confused that we are not able to decide what to do and what not and we even get frustrated with the things happening to us and start questioning to god.
        There were many times in my life when I asked God, why is this only happening to me ? What did I do wrong ? Why should I have to put up with this nonsense? Why does this thing or that thing happen to me? Why did I not get a forever friendship or relationship ? Why am I hurt most of the time by the people I love ? Am I this bad for everyone? ... and many more questions like this. 
        I know that many people like me, ask God similar questions and are frustrated with the events going on in their lives. <br><br>
        
        But, believe me, you will get all of your answers; everything in your life is happening to teach you something. God has all the plans for your betterment. <br>
        In my case, most of the time when I asked these types of questions to myself or to God, I got the answers one by one at a particular point in life. <br>
        For example, I got the answer five months later to one of my questions, which is "How is it good for me that my friendship ended with my best friend ?" 
        At that time, I was so sad and was like "Why did this happen?" Many thoughts came into my mind, like it was all going well then What did I do wrong ?  <br>
        Did I overreact?  <br>Did she do something wrong to me? But now I can say that it is so good for me that this friendship ended because it may be possible that 
        it would add too much trouble and toxicity to my life if I continued that friendship. I learned far too many lessons from my actions and the events of my life.  <br>
        Not only in this friendship, but in many stories throughout my life, I know I received answers to all of my why, how, and what questions at the right time in
        life.<br><br>
        
        Trusting yourself is the most important thing in life . Many times it happend that you think you are going in wrong way or you are doing something wrong
        but trust me whether this phase teach you something or it gonna be right for your life.Everthing that happens in your life has some motive for you,
        its just that you will only realise it at some correct point of time in your life.<br><br>
        
        Therefore, when anything happens in your life, don't ask the question "WHY ME ?"
        IT'S YOU because by the help of this phase, God wants to teach you something or may be he planned something that leads your life towards triumph.<br><br>
        
        Also, one thought comes to my mind right now that someone once said ---"THE WAY YOU THINK IS THE WAY YOU FEEL."
        So try to think positively. I know it is sometimes so difficult, but the only way is 
        Trust yourself... 
        Trust your thoughts...
        Believe in your timing...
        Trust the events happens...
        It's going to be great for you in the end...<br><br>
